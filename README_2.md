## 🔧 How to Run

1. Clone this repository or open the notebook in Google Colab.
2. Run the code to train the binary classifier.
3. Upload your own `0` or `1` digit image and test the model’s prediction.

## 💡 What I Learned

- The importance of preprocessing image data correctly (28x28, grayscale, normalization).
- How neural networks can model non-linear decision boundaries even in simple binary tasks.
- How to test models with **real-world data** outside the training set.
- Reinforced concepts from Andrew Ng’s ML Specialization (Course 2) through real practice.
