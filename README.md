# üß† Binary Digit Classifier (0 vs 1)

This project is a simple neural network-based image classifier that distinguishes between handwritten digits **0** and **1**. It was created as a personal learning exercise to reinforce the concepts taught in **Andrew Ng's Machine Learning Specialization ‚Äî Course 2: Advanced Learning Algorithms**, specifically on **neural networks for image classification**.

## üìö Purpose

The main goal of this project is not to push state-of-the-art performance, but to:

- Practice implementing a neural network from scratch using **Scikit-learn**.
- Understand how image data (like MNIST) can be flattened and fed into a neural network.
- Gain hands-on experience with **binary classification** tasks.
- Supplement my theoretical learning with practical, real-world experimentation.

## üß∞ Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Scikit-learn** (`MLPClassifier`)
- **NumPy**, **Matplotlib**
- **PIL** for image preprocessing
- **Google Colab** (project built and tested on mobile browser)

---

## üîç Project Highlights

- Trained a neural network to classify handwritten digits (0 vs 1) from the MNIST dataset.
- Achieved high accuracy on test samples.
- Tested the model with my **own handwritten digits** captured via mobile camera.
- Preprocessed handwritten image samples (resize, grayscale, normalization, flattening).
- Explored the effect of model tuning (e.g., hidden layers, activation functions).
